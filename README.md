## Data Models

The three core Mongoose models and their relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +ObjectId _id
        +String name
        +String tel
        +String email
        +String role
        +String password
        +String resetPasswordToken
        +Date resetPasswordExpire
        +Date createdAt
        +getSignedJwtToken() String
        +matchPassword(password) Boolean
    }

    class Campground {
        +ObjectId _id
        +String name
        +String address
        +String district
        +String province
        +String postalcode
        +String tel
        +String region
        +Number capacity
        +ObjectId owner
    }

    class Booking {
        +ObjectId _id
        +Date checkInDate
        +Date checkOutDate
        +Date actualCheckIn
        +Date actualCheckOut
        +Number nightsCount
        +ObjectId user
        +String guestName
        +String guestTel
        +ObjectId campground
        +String status
        +Date cancelledAt
        +Date createdAt
    }

    User "1" --> "0..*" Campground : owns
    User "1" --> "0..*" Booking : makes
    Campground "1" --> "0..*" Booking : has
```

**Notes:**
- `User.password` is hashed via bcryptjs and excluded from query results (`select: false`)
- `User.role` ∈ `{ user, campOwner, admin }`
- `Booking.user` is nullable — a booking belongs to either a registered `User` **or** a walk-in guest (`guestName` + `guestTel`), never both
- `Campground.bookings` is a virtual reverse-populate (not stored in the document)

## Business Rules

- **Stay duration**: 1–3 nights per booking
- **Capacity check**: Bookings are rejected if the campground is at full capacity for any night in the requested range
- **Concurrent check-ins**: Maximum 5 simultaneous checked-in bookings per campground
- **Booking scopes**:
  - `user` — sees only their own bookings
  - `campOwner` — sees bookings for their campgrounds
  - `admin` — sees all bookings
- **Cancellation**: Only allowed on `confirmed` bookings; checked-in or checked-out bookings cannot be cancelled

### Booking Status Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> confirmed : booking created
    confirmed --> checkedIn : campOwner checks in guest
    confirmed --> cancelled : user / admin cancels
    checkedIn --> checkedOut : campOwner checks out guest
    checkedOut --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]

    state "checked-in" as checkedIn
    state "checked-out" as checkedOut
```
